def =machine learning is a technique to implement AI that can learn from the data 
     by themselves without being explicity programmed 


types=
    supervised=the machine learning algorithm learns from labelled data

    eg=
        lets say , an algorithm wants to detetict weather the given image is of apple 
        or mango 

        then we will take the serival images of apple and mangoes and tell these 
        machines that these are apples and these are mangoes,,these names are called labels 

        we will feed these data to our machine learning model then our ml model trys to find pattern
        in these images and onces its learn from data 
        then if we provide the unknown image then it can successfuly recrognize its apple or mango
        this is a supervised learning

    unsupervised learning=the machine learning algorithm learn from unlabelled data

    eg= 
       take the simmier example

       in this we will give serival images of apple and mango to our ml model and we wount tell that 
       which image belong to which 

       now it trys find a pattern and group all the images in group1 and group2 and when you give another 
       image it will tell weather it belong to group1 or group2
       this called unsupervised learning

    Reinforcement learning=in this area of ml concered with how intelligent agents take action in an 
                           to maximize its rewards

        it has 4 major accepts
        1)Environment 
        2)agent
        3)action
        4)reward

        here the agent takes a action in Environment and the action is right the agent gets a positive reward
        else negitive
