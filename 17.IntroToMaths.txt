There are 4 major subjects of maths 

1)Liner algebra
= here we are dealing with vactors and matrix 
2)statices 
= data = mean value of different coloums, standerd deviation ,,to see any outlayers in our dataset
3)probablity
= it is liklywhood of some decitions
4)calculas
= a)integration
  b)deffiration
  it is used to obtimise the model 


ther are 3 main pillers of machine learning
1)data 
= for understanding the data better we need statices,,the liner algebra is also useful here 
  ,,when there is data poins of 10 rows ,,10 coloums then we can say a matrix of 10x10 so all the 
  computation would be in the form of matrix
2)model
= all the computation are based on Liner algebra ,,and servel staticial conceps are also integrated in 
= lots of machine learning model
3)training
= it is not saficient to training the model with the data ,,so we need to obtimise this machine learning
  model we need to do a lot of twicking and this is where calculas will help us 

these are verious aspects where maths can be used
